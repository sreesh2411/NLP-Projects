## Auto Text Generation:
Generation of Natural Language (NLG) It performs the function of a translator, converting digital data into natural language representation. Text planning, Sentence planning, and Text Realization are the essential components.<br>
Dataset: https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.006/s08/lecturenotes/files/t8.shakespeare.txt <br>
The dataset was chosen from shakespeare lecturenotes with the following goal in mind. Our final goal is to generate the 51st text from a seed text of 50 words for a particular sentence.<br>
As a result, we were able to create models to generate the 51st text for a given sentence with 50 words as seed text.
This can come in handy when we're writing a business or personal email or essay. Made use of Tensorflow, Keras and LSTM.

## Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis
